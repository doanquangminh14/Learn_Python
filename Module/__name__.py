# if __name__ == __main__: (this script can be imported OR run standalone) 
#                           Function and classes in this module can be reused
#                           without the main block of code executing

#                helps readability,
#                leave no gobal variables,
#                avoid unintended execution)
# ex. library = Import library for functionality
#               when running library directly, display a help page
